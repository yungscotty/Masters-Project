# Masters-Project
This repository includes the code used to achieve the line detection results in my MEng final report, as well as a couple videos of the omnicopter flight tests.
## Flight test videos
### "restricted_rpy_test.mp4" 
This video shows a test where the omnicopter takes off, rolls, pitches then yaws.
### "unrestricted_flight_test.mp4" 
This video shows the omnicopter lifting off in the MAST lab.
## Line detection code
The code here may be slightly altered from what was shown in the report, though all the code is still there to play about with if desired.
### "lineScanner.py" 
This code is the one used for displaying lines on a picture that is input. Two stock images of doorways can be found in the "Photos" folder.
### "liveFeed.py"
This code takes in the feed from your webcam, and performs real-time line detection on the video.
